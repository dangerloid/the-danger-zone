# Create a Basic JavaScript Object
Objects are collections of data that store them in key-value pairs and define their properties and behavior.

Example:

```js
let duck = {
	name: 'Aflac',
	numLegs: 2
};
```

Exercise: create a `dog` object with `name` and `numLegs` properties, and set them to a string and a number respectively.

```js
let dog = {
	name: 'Pluto',
	numLegs: 4
};
```
