# Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea

- "categories are bad" -> the notion that categories limit access by causing a rigid structure that hinder organic thinking

- argument 1
	- start with the structure and file the material
	- notes have to fit the structure
	- if they don't, compromise

- counter
	- fluid categorization is not top-down
	- notes aren't required to fit the structure
	- no compromise
	- home note: pre-existing structure, ==fluid==, can change over time
	- read [https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/)

- argument 2
	- static categories -> rigid, human brains -> not rigid.
		- static categories -> hinder organic knowledge growth
	- "categories equal top-down oppressive hierarchies"
		- see [[Heterarchy]]

- counter
	- MOCs -> pop up organically as needed

- argument 3
	- no categories still fine

- counter
	- having 100+ notes you may
		- use a tagging system
		- starred notes
		- daily notes
