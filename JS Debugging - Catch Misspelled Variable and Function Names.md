# JS Debugging - Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names
The `console.log()` and `typeof` methods are the two primary ways to check intermediate values and types of program output.

A common form of bug is the reference error, and one that fast typers can run into is the spelling error.

Transposed, missing, or mis-capitalized characters in a variable or function name will have the browser looking for an object that doesn't exist.
