[[Evergreen Notes]]
# Evergreen notes are things or opinions on things

- statements on clear opinions
- clear opinions need things to form opinions on

- *concepts*
	- can and should stand on their own
- *known things*
	- things everyone knows
- *standards*
	- like programming and such
- definitions, terms, topics, persons, places or anything else

Examples:

- `[[Magna Carta]]` (thing) can link to `[[No one is above the law]]` (opinion), which can link to `[[Protests can invoke radical change]]` (opinion)
- `[[Defining a variable]]` (thing) can lead to `[[Understanding variables leads to higher level thinking]]`
- `[[Like begets like]]` (opinion/fact) can link to `[[The neural formation of habits are additive]]` (opinion)
- strong opinions weakly held ([[Confirmation Bias]])
