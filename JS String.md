[[JS Data Types]]
# String

A string is plain text. It's always enclosed in single quotes, double quotes or backticks.

```javascript
"I'm a string!"
'I am also a string'
`Another string`
```

## properties

[[JS .length Property]]

## escaping literal quotes in strings

If your string contains a quote it will break, but you can escape it to make it work.

#### backslash

```javascript
const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."
```

#### quoting strings with single quotes

You can use other types of quotes to escape. It makes the code more readable.

```javascript
const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
```

## escape sequences

code | output
---| --------
`\'` | single quote
`\"` | double quote
`\\` | backslash
`\n` | newline
`\r` | carriage return
`\t` | tab
`\b` | backspace
`\f` | form feed

Example:

```javascript
const ESCAPE = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";
```

This will be output as:

```
FirstLine
	\SecondLine
ThirdLine
```

## string concatenation

You can use the `+` [[JS Mathematical Operations|operator]] to concatenate strings.

Example:

```javascript
const doors = "This is the start." + " This is the end."
```

#### string concatenation with `+=`

You can also concatenate strings by using the `+=` operator.

```javascript
let strPlusEquals = "This is the first sentence. ";
strPlusEquals += "This is the second sentence.";
```

#### constructing strings with [[JS Variables|variables]]

Sometimes it might be necessary to concatenate strings through variables.

```javascript
const myConcName = "Chris";
const myConcStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
```

#### appending variables to a string

```javascript
const someAdjective = "tedious";
let complaining = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective; // output is "Learning to code is tedious"
```

## bracket notation

#### find first character in string

This is a way to find a character in a specific index within a string.
Indexing in JavaScript starts at 0.

```javascript
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastNameMarkTwo = "Lovelace";

firstLetterOfLastName = lastNameMarkTwo[0]; // output will be "L"
```

#### find nth character in string

You can use bracket notation to find characters in other positions.
Mind JavaScript's zero-indexing.

```javascript
const lastName = "Lovelace";
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // outputs "v"
```

#### find last character in a string

To find the last character in a string you don't need to know how many characters are in it. Just use the [[JS .length Property|.length]] property.

```javascript
const lastName = "Lovelace";
const lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1]; // outputs "e"
```

Since JavaScript is zero-indexed, you need to subtract 1 to the number generated by `.length`. `"Lovelace"` has 8 letters, so the last character's index will be 7.

#### find nth-to-last character in a string

Same concept as before.

```javascript
const lastName = "Lovelace";
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
```

#### string immutability

String values cannot be altered once created.

Example: 

```javascript
let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
```

This code won't change `myStr`'s value to `"Job"`. To do that, you need to reassign the value to the variable.

## create strings using template literals
ES6 introduced template literals. They're a type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

Template literals allow you to create multi-line string and to use string interpolation.

Example:

```js
const person = {
	name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
	age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;
```

There are some things to consider:
- the example uses backticks, not quotes, to wrap the string
- the string is multi-line, both in code and in output. No need to insert `\n` anymore!
- the `${variable}` syntax is a placeholder. Concatenation isn't necessary. To add a variable string, you just use a dollar sign in front of curly brackets.
	- you can also include expressions in a string literal: `${a + b}`

Exercise: use template literal syntax with backticks to create an array of list element (`li`) strings. Each list element's text should be one of the array elements from the `failure` property on the `result` object and have a `class` attribute with the value of `text-warning`. The `makeList` function should return the array of list item strings.
Use an iterator method to get the desired output:

```js
// output
[
	'<li class="text-warning">no-var</li>',
	'<li class="text-warning">var-on-top</li>',
	'<li class="text-warning">linebreak</li>'
]
```

```js
// exercise proper

const result = {
	success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"].
	failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
	skipped: ["no-extra-semi", "no-dup-keys"]
};

function makeList(arr) {
	const failureItems = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		failureItems.push(`<li class="text-warning">${arr[i]}</li>`)
	}
	return failureItems;
}

const failuresList = makeList(result.failure);
```
