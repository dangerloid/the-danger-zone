# Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object
Dot notation is used on the object name followed by the name of the property.

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
```

Exercise: print both properties of the `dog` object to your console.

```js
let dog = {
	name: 'Spot',
	numLegs: 4
};

console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);
```
