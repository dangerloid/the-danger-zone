# Benefits of LYT frameworks

## provides reliability

The home note and MOCs act as homebases to organize thoughts when there's too many of them. They're comforting in their order and are so useful for those suffering from anxiety.

## provides flexibility

[[Fluid Frameworks]] curate access to your notes instead of limiting it and provide direction in your system.

## launches the brain

The LYT Framework has all your personal reminders related to knowledge and key terms. Helps organize thoughts by reducing energy to form and connect ideas.

## enhances note retrieval

Retrieving notes becomes easier when they're available through multiple access points.

## alleviates overwhelm

You can add structure by using [[Maps of Content]]. They act as indexes for specific topics and are useful for anxious people or people suffering with [[Anxiety Disorders]].
I mentioned overwhelm in [[Obsidian - How to Organize Your Notes]].

## encourages relational, positional thinking

Maps of Content aid you in forming connections between notes and add additional meaning to them.

## aids in linking with pre-built contexts

Your main categories (~10) help categorizing your notes and enhance long-term storage and retrieval.

## future-proofs for your future self

The LYT helps you avoid getting anxiety if you don't open your library for extended periods of time.

## improves memories

There are three factors through which the LYT helps you with this:

1. [[Reps]] - Repetition helps a lot with memory. I experimented this with Kanji and spaced repetition.
2. Conceptual Thinking - Maps of Content force you to consider the qualities of your thoughts and how they connect to other thoughts. #todo [[Cobwebs into Cables]]
3. [[Spatial Context]] - Your main MOCs can act as a spatial constellation if numbered. They will always be at the top of your sidebar.

## increases satisfaction

The LYT can help with finding joy in working with your notes. It doesn't make sense to take notes if you're not enjoying it.
