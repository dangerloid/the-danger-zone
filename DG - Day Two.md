# DG - Day Two

Today I plan to watch a video series on Jekyll with Bulma CSS.

Turns out I don't understand for loops.

What I really like about Static Site Generators and templating languages (Jekyll uses [[Liquid]], which is similar to [[Nunjucks]]) is the modularity of every part of the code, from layouts to includes and a file structure where everything is in its place where it should be. I could never go back and develop a site (or any kind of software really) without this feature. It makes my brain function better and avoids me writing long files.

From what I've seen right now, Jekyll bears a lot of similarity with Eleventy, except the latter has a lot of options for templating, when the former only has Liquid, and is built on Node instead of Ruby, but the file structure feels the same. I can say that I feel at home using both. Can't say that for other SSGs though, since I haven't tried them yet. But I plan to make mock ups of the same project in multiple SSGs to test them. I don't know React yet so I don't know how I'm gonna go with Gatsby.js, since that's what it's built on, but I'll manage. I want to learn as much as possible.
