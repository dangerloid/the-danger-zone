[[Note Taking]], [[Knowledge Bases]]
# LYT Kit v5 MOC

The LYT Kit is the companion to Nick's 6-week course on the Framework.
It serves as a template to build your [[Personal Knowledge Manager]], even though I prefer to build it from scratch. Not that I don't mind a helping hand, but I want to go *really deep* into it.

## before i start
This is gonna be huge. I'm making this an MOC and dividing everything into smaller notes since I'm annotating a vault. I have high expectations on this. I've already skimmed some of the content contained in the kit and it seems super exhaustive on the topic.

## diving into the LYT Kit

I got presented with a really dense MOC, with each link detailing every aspect of the LYT Framework.
I'm going to learn what MOCs are and why they're so useful, learn about [[Evergreen Notes]] through [[Forge evergreen notes in a process called note-making|note-making]], how to use MOCs to store information and develop my [[000 Index|Index]].
