# Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method

#todo research [[Knowledge Work]]

- zettelkasten: holistic method on how to deal with knowledge
- fun and addicting for many people (hope to see myself enjoying the process, i sure am rn!)
- put effort in ur notes
- learning the method is a process
	- the feeling of not producing anything useful is temporary - perseverance
- > A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

## Luhmann's Zettelkasten

- he published 50 books and over 600 articles using this method
- 150 unfinished manuscript
	- including a 1000 page long text
- his zettelkasten
	- collection on notes on index cards inside cabinets
	- he could navigate through them with ~~un~~reasonable amount of time and energy
	- hypertexts
		- surfable (like wikipedia)
		- more effort required if it's made of paper
		- entry points required for navigation

## Why Are We So Interested In Luhmann's Zettelkasten?

- his productivity system seems too much of an overkill for me as i'm not a scientist or a writer, but a programmer
	- i do like to take notes on programming though, and i need a method to sort through all the concepts, as it's a really broad subject

- connectivity of thoughts
	- hypertext -> links -> connect ideas through links
	- connections may be unexpected
- [[Productivity MOC|Productivity]]
	- streamlining workflow by giving guidelines on what to do -> decreases friction
- avoid wasting effort
	- by archiving notes, even if you don't use them, they're still available for later use, to:
		- avoid research on already researched topics
		- stop wasting time and energy
		- start working on projects as soon as possible
- complex problems
	- concentration on small parts of the problem
		- through atomic notes i assume
	- bird's eye view
- scales itself to the problem at hand
	- inevitably normal notes are gonna be bloated
	- read [[Communicating with Slip Boxes]]
- easier, coherent writing
	- enhances focus

## The Fixed Address of Each Note

- Luhmann used a numbering system
	- first note is 1, second note related to 1 is 2
		- if you add to 1, it's 1a. if you add to 1a, it's 1a1
	- organic growth
		- how wikis work (see wikipedia, scp foundation)
	- linking
		- emphasis on hypertexts
		- non-linear
	 > It is *not* important where you place a new note as long as you can link to it.
		 > - from [[Communicating with Slip Boxes]]

- numbering system
	- made paper-based hyperlinking possible
	- no search engine
		- paper register as index
			- not a tag system
			- list of possible entry points
	- few IDs in his system
		- the word system had one entry
			- ironic to see that he was developing a *system theory*

## A Zettelkasten Is a Personal Tool for Thinking and Writing

- *communicating*
	- as in [[Communicating with Slip Boxes]]
- zk is organic and non-linear and that's a good thing for forming ideas
- the most important traits of a Zettelkasten
	1. hyper-textual
	2.  atomic
	3. personal

### hyper-textual

- texts that refer to each other
	- connected via topics and ideas
	- big emphasis on relationships between notes
 > _A Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority_.
- text = linear, hyper-text = organic

- individual note = Zettel
	- from German: paper slip
	- unique address
		- connection between Zettels

### atomic

- [[Create Zettel from Reading Notes According to the Principle of Atomicity|Principle of Atomicity]]
	- each Zettel contains one (1) unit of knowledge (atoms)
	- book analogy:
		- each book has chapters, sections, pages w/ unique numbers to refer to
			- not useful for referring to thoughts, concepts and ideas
	- wikipedia:
		- not a web of thoughts
		- meant to be an information retrieval tool (encyclopedia)
- atomic notes
	- reference unambiguous
	- ! use highly descriptive titles for your atomic notes

### personal

- every person thinks differently ergo
	- one zk per person, one person per zk
- personal thinking tool
	- if publishing your notes, be careful in what you write

## Anatomy of a Zettel

![[Pasted image 20220315163437.png]]

1. unique identifier
	- unambiguous address for your note
	- various options:
		- Luhmann ID [[Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method#Luhmann's Zettelkasten|as described here]]
		- time based: YYYYMMDDHHhh (202203151725)
		- arbitrary unique string: 
			- incremental numbers, string generators or anything
			- cons: not human readable
		- title: must be unique
			- tips for self reference:
				- make them as descriptive as possible

2. body
	- where you store the content of your note
	- write in your own words
		- improves recall of processed information
	- atomic!!!!
	- if doubtful, write
	- deviation is ok
		- byproducts: not waste
		- can be useful for future projects
		- they connect to other parts of the system

3. references
	- sources go here, leave blank if it's an original thought
	- reference management?? like zotero???
	- citekey: last name + year
	- reference other notes (backlinking)
	- no reference: your own original thought

## Connecting Zettel

- emphasis on connection + how it affects the brain
	- knowledge relationships improve recall and train your mind in seeing patterns
- i connected this [[What is a note|note]] to an unrelated topic (the Italian education system) the other day
	- i don't have a note on it though, there's no reason for me to make one by now
- learning and understanding topics by linking notes
- adding links without context will be unfruitful
	- no context given = no new knowledge
	- your future self won't know why they should click that link

## Structure Notes

- hub notes ([[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]])
	- meta note
	- zettel about other zettels and their relationships
	- classification system for easy searching
	- [[Maps of Content]]?
- benefit of hierarchical structures: potential for knowledge creation
- semilattice structure:
	- not a strict tree structure
	- cross-connections between branches
- [[Heterarchy]]

## How to Implement a Zettelkasten

### Choosing Software

- features to look for
	1. hypertexts
		- either:
			- the software must have linking natively implemented
			- stick to full text search 
				- tedious, long and uncomfortable
	2. navigation
		- full text search
			- again, tedious
			- equivalent to [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]]'s paper system'
		- links
	3. sandbox
		- pull out as many notes as you need to draw connections
		- [[Andy Matuschak|Andy]] mode helps
