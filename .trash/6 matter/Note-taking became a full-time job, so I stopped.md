## Highlights
* Smart Notes seemed
* like more than just a cure to my writer's block. It was a system.
* I felt like Smart Notes had given me a way to reverse engineer the process of
* writing itself.
* Despite the failure, I told myself “you just need to try harder”.
* I re-read the
* book and this time used Smart Notes to take notes on Smart Notes.
* After a month and 76 physical index
* cards later I had my physical Zettelkasten!
* Effortlessly the words sprung onto the page. It wasn’t until I
* checked the word count a few days later that I realized I had written 4,000 words.
* I wasn’t writing an update, I was writing a book.
* I applied Smart Notes to my research.
* In a month’s time, I had read four books,
* written two hundred or more notes, and connected them elaborately to an index.
* it wasn’t helping me write.
* It was supposed to remove
* writer’s block with endless idea generation and material.
* there I sat staring at a blank screen.
* Unless a note could be taken wholesale and pasted into my writing, I
* couldn’t find a way to make them seamlessly line up and have only the transitions between notes left to write.
* Instead of endlessly rearranging my notes within Obsidian for the perfect
* sequence, I just started to write.
* I learned that the human brain can’t be replaced. Ultimately it’s the writer who’s the creator.
* Instead, I’ll batch note-taking.
* let the ideas in books age,
* Improving the quality and reducing the number of your notes.
* Instead of attempting to capture every nugget of information in my knowledge base, I’ll let memory do its job. Forget. What repeats will be recorded.
* My biggest mistake wasn’t taking so many notes, but not leaving enough room for my own creative process to mold the workflow.
* It has to serve you and not the other way around.
