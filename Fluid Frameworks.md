# Fluid Frameworks

- non-rigid, highly flexible
- higher-order notes
- not mutually exclusive - link freely to other MOCs and notes
- MOCs > folders
- add any structure at any time due to their innate fluidity
- cons: can't apply fluid structures to [[Programming]] projects unless i find a way to do this but eh
	- coming from [[Unix]] file systems, i find it very hard to adjust to fluid file categorization. 

### fluid frameworks vs rigid frameworks

- non-essential for structure, unlike folders
- folders are a rigid framework
- can use folders in smart ways if you have a robust fluid setup
