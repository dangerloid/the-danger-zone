# LaTeX "Installation"
"Installation" is in quotes because to work with LaTeX you need multiple programs installed on your system, namely a TeX system and a text editor.

## LaTeX systems
A TeX system is a set of behind the scenes programs that are needed to make LaTeX work. You don't run them directly.
The recommended system I installed was [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/)

>[!INFO]
>The TeX Live installation can take more than a hour to finish, so it's best to change mirror when installing it via network.
>For future reference.

## editors
Since LaTeX files are simply plain text, you can use any editor to write them, but it can be easier to have a TeX focused editor to write them in. You wouldn't code a game in C in Text Edit would ya?


## working online
There's a variety of online editors so that you don't have to install anything on your system, just to try it out. I preferred to just install the needed software on my machine because I don't want to entrust websites with my files. There are options and I do have an Overleaf account, but it bugs me that Git integration is a paid feature and that I can't download my .tex files on my hard drive.
