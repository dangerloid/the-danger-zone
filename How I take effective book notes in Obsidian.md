# How I take effective book notes in Obsidian

Taking book notes always felt like a chore or a daunting task to me. I want to change that, especially with non-fiction books, because I tend to really forget those.
I don't need notes for fiction, as it's strictly entertainment, unless it's a classic or something.

I won't highlight passages from a book unless it's digital but I can try and take notes on stickies and attach them to my book.
I have multiple unread non-fiction books and some of them are scientific in nature (ie. [[Psychology]], neuropsychiatry) and I fear that I might forget what I read. It happened before with books on much simpler concepts.

In her video, Rachel explains that she takes her book notes through bullet points, which is what I started doing as well after I started to use Obsidian. I outline all my notes in bullets as I consume the content if it's a video, or while skimming through my notes in the book after I read and annotated it.

Ultimately what matters is that I understand what I wrote, because my notes are made for my brain. I personally don't mind sharing them with others, but my priority is that they're valuable to me and me only, as they compose my knowledge.
