# Comments

Comments bits in the code that do nothing. They serve as notes, without interfering with the code itself.

Use cases:

- in-line comment

```javascript
// hello world program

console.log("Hello world!")
```

- multi-line comment

```javascript
console.log("Hello world!")

/* this is a
Hello world
program */
```
