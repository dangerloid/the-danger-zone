# What are higher-order notes?

- every note in a library is a note:
	1. a [[What is a note|note]] with mostly words
		- less complex
	2. a note with mostly links to other notes
		- higher-order note
			- still a note, but links add structure and complexity

## what can we call higher-order notes?

- expanding vocabulary to avoid [[Newspeak]] situations

### exploring types of higher-order notes

- **link note** - composed by links
- **hub note** - navigational note, airport hub ([[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]])
- **index note** - references other notes
- **workbench** - brain dump
- **outline note** - early-stage note taking
- **structure note** - provides structure
- **structure zettel** - TOC with annotations
- **table of contents** - reference structure
- **map of content** - higher-order note that does all of the above + active thinking tool

### mocs can

- structure links
- contain any type of content
- be linked to other MOCs which can be linked to the home
- MOCs concentrate & accelerate idea interaction
