# Obsidian - How to Organize Your Notes

The video is an overview of the IMF (Index MOC Framework) created by [[Nick Milo]], which is a proto-LYT framework.

## overview

The IMF Is a light organization framework to build a [[Personal Knowledge Manager]], flexible enough to let you use various note taking system such as the [[Zettelkasten method]], [[Evergreen Notes]] and [[PARA]].
It consists of two things:

### index

The homepage, the beating heart of the system. This is where the organization system is defined through links and Maps of Content. Serves as a hub for the vault and as a landing page for published Obsidian notes.

### maps of content (MOCs)

[[Maps of Content]] are smaller indexes for more specific topics. Still broad, but not as broad as the homepage. MOCs can be nested inside each other.

## building the system

The topics, MOCs and other things are categorized by numerical prefixes, much like the [[Dewey Decimal System]] for libraries.

The [[000 Index|Index]] will be 000. 

### indexing

What I'm gonna do with my index is outline the broader areas to categorize my topics. 

Currently (as of 2022-03-10), my index is categorized by topic, but I find it to be too confusing and disorganized. What I plan to do over the next days is research enough and streamline my areas of interest into really broad categories (no more than 6).

### Maps of Content

When creating a MOC, a good idea is linking back to the previous level, so that you have a breadcrumb to reference where you are in your system.
I plan to split up my MOCs into smaller sections, containing other MOCs, which may contain other MOCs and notes linked to that topic for easy sorting.

## takeaways

Ultimately, I'm just gonna start taking notes and building the system as I go, adding to and perfecting my system as I write more. 
It's best to start simple to avoid overwhelm.
