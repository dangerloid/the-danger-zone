# JS Debugging - Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles (DevTools) for debugging JavaScript.
You can find DevTools in your browser's menu.

The [[JS console.log()|console.log()]] method, which prints the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most useful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in the code can show you intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout the code will help narrow down where the problem is.
