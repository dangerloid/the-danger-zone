# What is LaTeX?
When using LaTeX you don't get a WYSIWYG editor. The point is to exploit [[The power of plain text]], enriching it with markup, which tells LaTeX about the logical meaning of elements of the text.

## workflow
LaTeX files are a set of instructions on what each part of the document should be. When you want to share what you wrote, you don't give out the .tex file, but typeset it into a PDF and send it out.

>[!NOTE]
>Writing in LaTeX is somewhat similar to programming, so sometimes, instead of 'typesetting', the act of taking the source file and put it in a PDF is called 'compiling', although 'typesetting' is the correct term.

## multiple runs
For simple files, typesetting once can be enough. But as the document gets more complex you may need to typeset more than once.
