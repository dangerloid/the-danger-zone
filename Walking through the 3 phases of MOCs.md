[[The 3 Phases of MOCs]]
# Walking through the 3 phases of MOCs

## the IRL process

1. read interesting stuff on a topic
2. take a note
3. you make more notes on the topic
4. you worry you might lose them

- [[Mental Squeeze Point]]

## assemble

- compiling notes on the topic
	- a recent example for me could be my notes on [[Note Taking]] and [[Knowledge Bases]]

## collide

- over multiple days:

- open a note and make an evergreen note out of it
	- split it
		- you have two evergreen notes
- since you assembled your notes, you can safely return to them on a later date

- form more notes
	- connections come natural when you have them laid out

## unify

- this is where the moc takes shape
