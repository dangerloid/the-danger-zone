[[LYT Kit v5|LYT Kit]]
# Is LYT For Me?

I have ~30 notes as of writing this (2022-03-11) and the kit says to ignore it if I have less than 100. 
But what I'm going to do is actually ==take notes== on the kit itself, so I win anyway.

**if you're starting out**

Structure is not a concern. Just write.

**if you've got ~100-500 notes**

It may start to be difficult to find your notes and you may want to start building up your MOCs.

**if you've got ~1000-5000 notes**

You'll want to structure your structures. Use your flexible frameworks.

**if you've got ~5000-50.000 notes**

It's gonna be *really hard* to find your notes, so dive headfirst.

Approach with caution. You don't want to start structuring your system from the start. Your system will be fragile and will turn against you, making you waste time and burning you out.
