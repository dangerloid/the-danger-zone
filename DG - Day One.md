# DG - Day One

Today is the day I start trying out some things for my digital garden. What I want to try out first is a Static Site Generator called Jekyll, which is always recommended for beginners.

Jekyll is built in Ruby, which I don't know shit of and it scares me, but eh.

When I started the project, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of files and styles there were built in. Was it necessary to give that many starter files? I mean I understand why the devs wanted to give a bit of a jumpstart to users but that's even more confusing to me. I'd rather have a minimal installation without example pages and themes so that I can build everything from the ground up.
But I'm determined to make it work. I need a personal space on the internet and I'm gonna fight tooth and nails for it.

Oops turns out there was a command for that-
