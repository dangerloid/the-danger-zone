# PKM Primer - An Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management for Creatives
## what is a personal knowledge manager?
- process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities (Wikipedia)

## personal information management + knowledge management
**pim**
- keep things in order to get them done (task manager)

**km**
- creating/sharing knowledge and information in an organization (technical documentation?)
- ==free flow of information==


- pkm combines the two + adds emphasis on sharing and creating

## three levels of knowledge
- knowledge: facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education (broad definition)

### Level 1 - having something (information)
- digital information (googling, files)

### Level 2 - understanding something (revelation)
- the ability to recall info w/o looking it up

### Level 3 - doing something (application)
- when info changes your day-to-day actions

## there's too much information
**FOMO**
- **f**ear **o**f **m**issing **o**ut
- desire to gain information that you don't have
- social media i.e. your twt mutuals hanging out w/o you
- jumping from inputs -> desire to know more even if you're unable to contribute to the convo

## how does a pkm help?
- reveals connections
- ==! give your brain space to think !==

### pkms = external brains
- make connections with what you already put there

### brains are:
- easily overwhelmed
- terrible at remembering things

### examples of pkms
- commonplace books (see [[Ryan Holiday]]'s explanation)
- mind maps
- [[Sketchnotes]]

## why you should give thought to your pkm?

### YOU ARE CREATIVE ###

the creativity process:
- input -> process -> output -> back to start

> Nothing is completely original
> - steal like an artist by Austin Kleon

- no output? change either:
	- input
	- process

PKMs help connecting ideas and make it easier to do your creative work

## what makes a good pkm?
- it's not a single application, but rather an ecosystem of apps and methods to do various tasks

### components of a good pkm
- **note taking**: a place to write your notes (text-based for easier sharing)
- **quick capture**: tool to capture ideas so that it doesn't get lost, like a small notebook or your phone
- **visual thinking**: like the graph mode in Obsidian, paired with [[Andy Matuschak|Andy]] mode
- **read it later**: aggregators (raindrop.io ecc.)
- **project management**: task manager/planner/bujo
- **archive**: where to hold things when you're done with them
- **output**: your pkm is meant to make it easy for you to create
after connecting the dots, you need to output the ideas. start by writing.

### KISS ###

## the problem with the filing cabinet - the trend towards [[Zettelkasten method|Zettelkasten]]
Filing cabinet:
- you know where to look when you want to find something

The problem:
- thinking before finding the file
- you won't see it until you actively search for it

## tips

### curate your collection
- not every idea is worth having space in your pkm

### supplement your workflow
- no need to change your system b/c you found a new app
- try to integrate it

### consider your sources
- there's too much information
- figure out what sources are worth paying attention to
