# Guiding Values of PKM

My digital library should:

1. be a joy to use
	- It doesn't have to be a chore to take notes and skim through them. It doesn't have to be a chore to think.
2. be future-proofed
	- The future you should be able to access your notes without hassle.
3. allow for fast and reliable note retrieval
	- Organization is key to this, especially when your digital library starts getting bigger and fuller with information.
4. encourage critical, creative, connecting and generative thinking
	- You should be able to connect your notes with each other and form new ideas from them.
5. encourage active, engaged, and contextual thinking
	- 
6. encourage lateral and metaphorical thinking
	- See things from new perspectives.
7. allow for the spontaneous cross-pollination of ideas
	- It may/will happen that new connections will form on their own.
8. produce finished products
9. accumulate in meaningful knowledge over time
10. compound in personal value over time
11. encourage repetition
	- Repetition strengthens memory

## guiding questions

- ==NOTE TO SELF== you're allowed to change the answers to these questions as your system changes

1.  Can I find what I'm looking for quickly? Easily?
	1.  It seems so, I'm trying to make my system as efficient and intuitive as I can from the start.
2. Am I able to think fast? Am I able to think deeply?
	1. Not yet. The system is not yet ultimated and it can be faulty at times, lacking some efficiency.
3. Can I be surprised by serendipitous connections?
	1. As of writing this (2022-03-11) I'm currently researching various methods of organization for my system, so I'm not suprised if everything is connected to note taking and knowledge management at the moment, but I can't wait to be surprised whenever I open my vault.
