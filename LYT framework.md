# LYT framework

L - Linking
Y - Your
T - Thinking

The LYT Framework helps supercharging your digital library by offering fluid organization solutions to help you find your notes quickly and develop ideas over time via connection to other notes. 

## why LYT?

LYT enhances your work experience through the homepage and MOCs, which are fluid and flexible notes designed to direct you through your system.

It's robust, flexible and highly customizable, which is a key point because your system is unique to you and you, as a person, will change and as you do, so will your system.

## what is the LYT Framework

LYT is a framework for notes that lets you easily find them and work with them, and allows them to get added value over time as you write.

### The Home note

The home note is your index and acts as a launching pad for the rest of your system. Provides a bird's eye view of your [[Second Brain]] for easy navigation.

### Maps of Content

Your categorization tool inside your system. They're less broad than your home, but still broad enough to contain various topics inside one note. These are where all your notes will be stored, sorted by category. MOCs help avoiding overwhelm and anxiety sprouting from disorganized notes.

### Other Fluid Frameworks

Keeping your frameworks fluid as a mean to keep both order and chaos in your system to
1. have a structured note library so that you know what a thing is and where to find it while
2. keep a sense of discovery while browsing your library and make connections to form new ideas.
