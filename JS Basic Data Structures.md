# JS Basic Data Structures
Data can be stores and accessed in many ways. We've already seen objects and arrays.

Here I'll learn more about the differences between arrays and object and which to use in different situations. I'll also learn how to use the `splice()` and `Object.keys()` methods to access and manipulate data.
