# What is a note?

- a container of thought
	- too broad

- single idea or entire library of thought

>A note is a container of thought that has meaning for the person who made it.

- [[Collector's Fallacy]]
	- the act of hoarding information because you're scared to lose it, while never having any free time to consume that information
	- information hoarders regurgitate what they learned instead of explaining it
		- much like the Italian education system!
	- by regurgitating information, they don't actually enjoy the process of thinking

- taking notes v. making notes
	- if i ever annotated a book, i can't remember anything from it. i know that i did annotate Crazy Rich Asians, but i can't remember what my notes were about (i really enjoyed that book though). I don't even remember what my annotation system was, nor could i make connection to other notes i've taken in that period.
