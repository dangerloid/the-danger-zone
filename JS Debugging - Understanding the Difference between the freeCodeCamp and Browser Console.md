# JS Debugging - Understanding the Difference between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console
The console in freeCodeCamp's challenges behaves differently from the browser console.
There are many methods to use with `console` to output messages. The freeCodeCamp console will only output `log` messages.
When you make changes to your code, the freeCodeCamp console updates itself automatically and is cleared each time the code is run.

Exercise: first, open your browser console so you can see the logs. Then find the `console` tab.
After that use `console.log()` to log the `output` variable. View the two consoles to see the log. Finally use `console.clear` after your log to clear the browser console.
