# Digital Garden MOC

I'm in the process of making my own little corner of the internet.
It's going to be a portfolio, a blog, a personal website and a cyberhell.

## technologies
### layout/prototyping
Figma
### templating
My site is going to be static, so the most logical choice would be a [[Static Site Generators|static site generator]].
I have a few options here, but I still need to evaluate what they will be.
### deployment
Either Github Pages or Netlify could be good choices.
