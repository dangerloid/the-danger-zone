## Overview

### assembling phase

- *assemble, collect, gather, curate, incubate*
	- on a new digital workbench
		- links to mocs

### colliding phase

- *collide, develop, rearrange, combine, split, craft*
	- relational positioning battle royale
		- Nick also used the battle royale analogy, originality at its finest

### unifying phase

- *unify & merge with the whole; enjoy, use, navigate, reference*
	- if you wrote it, it has meaning to you
	- different purposes:
		- content creation
		- reference point
		- navigational hub
- even if you don't work in that area of interest anymore, you can still reference it
