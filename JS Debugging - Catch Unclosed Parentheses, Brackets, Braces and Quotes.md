# JS Debugging - Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes
It can happen that you might forget to close a bracket and the browser throws an error because of it. Forgetting a piece tends to happen when you're editing existing code. Take care when nesting code blocks into others, such as adding a callback function as an argument to a method.

One way to avoid this is as soon as the opening character is typed, immediately include the closing match. Modern code editors do this automatically though.
