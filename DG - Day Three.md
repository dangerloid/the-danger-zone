`topics`:  [[Digital Garden]], [[Web Development]]

# DG - Day Three

It occurred to me that the Jekyll Bonsai docs have a section for people who want to build their own digital garden without relying on a template (although you *do* use a template for referencing). It lists all the plugins needed to make it work and gives directives on how to build it. I need to figure out if this is the route I want to take though, because I need a way to back up my notes as my computer is going to fail me soon.

So, I'm going to start a new Jekyll project.

I need to configure my Gemfile, so I'm going to make a new project with a compiled one for reference.

I decided that the title for my site will be "cyberhell". Might wanna change the directory name though.

I already messed up not understanding how and why my for loops don't work when I try to set up a navigation bar.

What I did is making a navbar include that is going to be displayed in every page at the top (except for the home page, which is gonna be unique). I made a separate layout for the home.

[[DG - Day Two|Day Two]] <- Day Three -> [[DG - Day Four|Day Four]]
